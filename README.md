# Hand-Gesture-Voice-Recognition
This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV. It captures video from a webcam, processes frames to isolate the hand, and detects the number of fingers using convex hull and convexity defects. The system provides visual feedback and triggers actions based on detected gestures.
